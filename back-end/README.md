# DormShare backend

## Run locally

From `back-end/`:

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `MOCKAROO_API_KEY` in `.env` using the team's private key, then run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The server uses `http://127.0.0.1:3001`. Restart it after changing `.env`.
MongoDB is not required for the Sprint 2 mock API.

- `GET /api/health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }` without loading data.
- `GET /api/mock-data` returns the shared users, listings, rentals, conversations,
  reviews, item requests, and Quick Borrow requests for #89.
- Failed data loads return safe JSON errors. A missing key returns 503. An
  upstream failure or invalid response returns 502. A later request can retry.

The current frontend still uses its existing Mockaroo proxy until #89 switches it.
Backend data stays in memory and resets when the server restarts.

## Add feature routes

Mount feature routers in `app.js` before the final API 404 handler. Use the same
store in every router:

```js
const data = await request.app.locals.mockDataStore.load();
const rentals = data.rentals.filter(
  (rental) => rental.ownerId === request.currentUserId,
);
response.json(rentals);
```

The first load fetches and validates Mockaroo data. Concurrent loads share one
request. Later loads return the same mutable object, so changes are visible to
other routes. Do not create separate copies of listings or rentals.

Keep existing field names and ID types. User IDs are strings. Listing and rental
IDs are numbers. Bookings use the `rentals` array and its `borrowerId`, `ownerId`,
`listingId`, `terms`, and `extensionRequest` fields. A missing optional
`quickBorrowRequests` collection becomes an empty array.

`currentUser` sets `request.currentUserId` to `owner-1`. It ignores identity
headers. This is the placeholder for #92, not a login system.

Validation and option values live in `../shared/`. The frontend imports the same
rules through its existing service and option paths.

## Owner listing routes

`routes/ownerListings.js` handles #106 under `/api/listings`:

| Method | Path | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/listings/mine` | Current owner's listings in every status |
| POST | `/api/listings` | Created draft listing, status 201 |
| PUT | `/api/listings/:id` | Updated listing |
| PATCH | `/api/listings/:id/status` | Listing with updated status |

POST and PUT require `title`, `category`, `description`, `price`, and
`rentalTerms`. Text fields must not be blank. Category must match the shared
options. Price must be a finite number of zero or more. Strings such as `"5"`
are not accepted as prices. PUT replaces all five editable fields.

The server assigns IDs, owner IDs, placeholder images, and the initial draft
status. POST and PUT ignore other submitted fields. PATCH changes only status
and accepts `draft`, `published`, or `paused`.

Edits and status changes return 404 for a missing listing and 403 for another
owner's listing. Invalid details or status values return 400 without changing
the records. Successful changes remain in the shared store until restart.

Search and individual item reads belong to #116 in a separate router. Mount
that router after `ownerListingsRouter` so `/mine` takes precedence over `/:id`.
Frontend integration remains in #108.

## Tests

```sh
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

Use Mocha and Chai. `createApp({ store })` and
`createMockDataStore({ apiKey, fetchImpl })` allow isolated tests without a real
Mockaroo key. `test/fixtures.js` supplies related example records.

`startTestServer(app)` in `test/helpers/server.js` starts a loopback server on an
available port. It returns `baseUrl` and an async `close()` function. Call
`close()` from the suite's cleanup hook.

The existing coverage script still includes only `app.js`. #90 will extend it.
To measure the new backend modules before that change lands, run:

```sh
npm exec -- c8 --all --include app.js --include 'routes/**' --include 'middleware/**' --include 'services/**' --reporter=text mocha 'test/**/*.test.js'
```
